# 🏨 Hotel Bookings and Cancellations Dashboard
### 📌 Project Overview
This project is an interactive dashboard created using Microsoft Excel to analyze hotel bookings and cancellations data. The dashboard provides insights into the total bookings, cancellation rates, and various patterns across different guest types, hotel types, and booking months. It helps to visualize key metrics, trends, and comparisons through bar charts, pie charts, and summary cards.

The purpose of this dashboard is to assist hotel management in understanding the patterns of guest bookings and cancellations, which can further help in optimizing revenue management, resource allocation, and customer engagement strategies.
